Shotter
===================

Shotter is a simple project I started after having some troubles with the captured app for macOS. The upload "API" *(uploader.php)* included is a minimal re-write of the [Captured-php](https://github.com/csexton/captured-php) script for [Captured](http://www.capturedapp.com).

upload.py will automatically upload the specified image to the server you have the /uploaded.php file located on. It will perform basic authentication and if successfully authenticated and if the file has been successfully uploaded, return the public link to the file and copy if to your clip board.

Since I'm an Apple geek it will currently only work on macOS.


To do
-------------

>**Features**

 > -  Make the command line arguments prettier/easier to use.
 > -  Create a GUI app or make the script watch certain folders for file changes and automatically upload.
 > - By doing the above hopefully make the project easier to use for non-tech savy users.
 > - Add automatic copying of link to clip-board on linux too.
 > - Make the code more pretty and easier to add to/modify.
 > - More awesomeness.

Installation
-------------

**uploader.php**
>**Step 1**
>Upload uploader.php to your web-root.
>
>**Step 2**
>Make sure apache/nginx has write access to the folder.

**upload.py**
> **Step 1**
> Make sure the shebang `#!/usr/bin/env python3` is added at the top of upload.py.
>
> **Step 2**
> Make the file executable: `chmod -x upload.py`
>
>**Step 3**
> Rename the file so we can get rid of the .py part. `mv upload.py upload`
>
> **Step 4**
> Create a folder to hold your personal scripts: `mkdir -p ~/bin`
> Copy upload.py to the newly created folder: `cp upload.py ~/.bin`
> Add export `PATH=$PATH":$HOME/bin"` to your .profile or .bash_profile.
> Test it out by typing `uploader -f [path_to_file]`


Usage
-------------

> **Command(s)**
> *upload -f [path_to_file]*
